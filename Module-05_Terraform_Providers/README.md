# 5. Terraform Provider Overview
  - Terraform make use of plugins called <i><b>Providers</i></b> to interact with cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure etc), SaaS providers, and other APIs.
  - By default, Terraform doesn't have any provider on the local machine.
  - Terraform configurations must declare which providers they require so that Terraform can install and use them.
  
  - Some Terraform providers require configuration (like endpoint URLs or cloud regions) before they can be used.
  - Providers are distributed separately from Terraform itself, and each provider has its own release sequence and version numbers.
  - The <i><b>Terraform Registry</i></b> stores publicly available Terraform providers, and hosts providers for most major infrastructure platforms.
